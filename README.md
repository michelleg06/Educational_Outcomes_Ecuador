## Next steps
### Define cluster convention (Michelle)
### Visualization of distributions of relevant variables
### Intracluster correlation
#### Run a simple hierarchical analysis (multilevel analysis)
### Define an interaction matrix
#### make an edgelist where 1 equals similar activitie between two agents and 0 means no similar activity
